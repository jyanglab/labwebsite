Our resesarch focuses on bridging the gap between genotypes and phenotypes. At a broader scale, I am keen to integrate various large-scale biological data sets such as phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics data and functional annotations to boost the power of **Genome-wide Association Study** and **Genomic Selection**.

Our lab's major interests include (1) using **quantitative and population genetics** approaches to dissect the genetic architecture of  agronomically important traits;
(2) exploring the **genetic basis** of heterosis and predicting hybrid performance by incorporating biological annotation information;
and (3) modeling complex phentoypes, such as molecular phenotypes, time series phenotypes, or phenotypes obtained via image analyses.
